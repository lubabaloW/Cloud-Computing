# Cloud-Computing
Whats is cloud computing ?
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST):
Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.

# The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) defines five essential characteristics of cloud computing in its Special Publication 800-145. These characteristics are:

-On-Demand Self-Service: Users can unilaterally provision computing capabilities, such as server time and network storage, as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with each service provider.

-Broad Network Access: Capabilities are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms (e.g., mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and workstations).

-Resource Pooling: The provider’s computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to consumer demand. There is a sense of location independence in that the customer generally has no control or knowledge over the exact location of the provided resources but may be able to specify location at a higher level of abstraction (e.g., country, state, or data center).

-Rapid Elasticity: Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released, in some cases automatically, to scale rapidly outward and inward commensurate with demand. To the consumer, the capabilities available for provisioning often appear to be unlimited and can be appropriated in any quantity at any time.

-Measured Service: Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service (e.g., storage, processing, bandwidth, and active user accounts). Resource usage can be monitored, controlled, and reported, providing transparency for both the provider and consumer of the utilized service.

# The cloud service infrastructure can be managed internally by a single organization for its own use or managed by a CSP that provides services to many organizations. These two models can be combined into a hybrid solution:

Public cloud:  A CSP owns the cloud deployment and allocates its resources to external, unaffiliated customers. Those customers share the public cloud’s resources without knowing precisely where their data is in relation to that of any other organization.
Private cloud:  Services are provided to only a single organization.
Hybrid cloud:  There is a combination of two or more private, public, or community deployments.

# Understanding the foundations of cloud computing calls for an understanding of cloud service models. In this section, we focus on the models that represent computing environment services:

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):  The hardware infrastructure is provided to the consumer. The consumer assumes responsibility for all layers above that hardware. The CSP manages hardware failures, firmware updates, device drivers, and hardware compatibility. The consumer installs and manages the operating system on top of the hardware as well as any services and applications that run above that operating system.
Platform as a Service (PaaS):  The service structure is provided by the CSP. It is up to the consumer to populate that structure, manage it on a day-to-day basis, and assume responsibility for the content. Support for the hardware, as well as the service platform that hosts the content, is offloaded to the CSP.
Software as a Service (SaaS):  The consumer is being provided with the direct use of the software. Responsibility for the hardware where that software runs, the operating system upon which it runs, and the installation and patching of the software itself are all offloaded to the CSP.
